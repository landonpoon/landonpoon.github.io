      <p>I had a lot of time to listen to music in 2020 and consequentially listened to a lot of music. Here are some of my favorite projects from 2020 that I recommend you check out if you haven't already. This list is by no means a comprehensive list of every album I enjoyed in 2020 nor a list of the "best" albums of the year, rather it's a list, in no particular order, of quality projects I find myself coming back to time and time again.
</p>
      <h2>Favorites</h2>

      <h3>Alfredo - Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist</h3>
      <p>Freddie is an excellent rapper. Al is an excellent producer. They still manage to be more than the sum of their parts. Gibbs's deep voice flows perfectly over Al's smooth beats, which leave enough room for Freddie to put on a masterclass in rapping.
</p>

      <p>Songs like "God Is Perfect" show how top-notch Gibbs's rapping is. Everything from the vocal inflections to the flow is perfect and cements Freddie as one of the best rappers working right now, and most likely the best rapper still in their peak.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>God Is Perfect</li>
        <li>Scottie Beam</li>
        <li>Frank Lucas</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <h3>how I'm feeling now - Charli XCX</h3>
      <p>Charli XCX continues to push pop forward on <em>how I'm feeling now</em>. She balances an almost 80s synth-pop aesthetic with the blown-out, experimental sounds that define PC music. It's a fitting way to represent the times. Pop culture has a foot planted firmly in both the past and future and Charli continues to bridge this gap.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Forever</li>
        <li>Claws</li>
        <li>Anthems</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Man Alive! - King Krule</h3>
      <p>King Krule's crooning was the soundtrack to the early days of quarantine. <em>Man Alive!</em> showcases King Krule's ability to create melancholic moods. The British artist is excellent at blending together different instruments and styles to create albums that feel continuous. This isn't a project you pick a couple of songs from and call it a day. These tracks work together, building on each other to create the musical equivalent of the most intense cloudy day imaginable.
</p>
      <p>Also, the album cover is outstanding. The abstract figure seems reminiscent of something Picasso would have created and would look just as good on the walls of an art gallery as it does in my Apple Music.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stoned Again</li>
        <li>Alone, Omen 3</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Before - EP - James Blake</h3>
      <p>Every song on this EP is good and could have warranted being named one of my favorites. What I like about this project is that James Blake takes the moody and spacey electronic music that made him famous and fused it with vocal chops that add almost a soulful aspect to this project. It's still melancholic and moody, but the pitched-up vocals contrast that incredibly well and it makes for an enjoyable listen.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I Keep Calling</li>
        <li>Summer of Now</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Price of Tea in China - Boldy James & The Alchemist</h3>
      <p>I could have put any of Boldy's 2020 projects on here. In fact, I think <em>Manger on McNichols</em> might be even better. But I listened to <em>The Price of Tea in China</em> more, so it made the list.
</p>
      <p>Again, The Alchemist's spacey and minimal beats allow the rapper, this time Detroit native Boldy James, ample room to tell their story. And tell stories Boldy does. The picture of paints of his life in Detroit is not pretty. The album starts with the lines: "I used to get confused/Choosing my battles wisely, I had to pick and choose/My friends came and went, but most of them was murder victims/Dead before 20 or caught a frame and had to serve a sentence." It's a chilling depiction of street life, and Boldy does it better than most.
</p>
      <p>Along with <em>Man Alive!</em>, <em>The Price of Tea in China</em> has one of my favorite album covers of the year. I bet you can see a theme here. Kei Imazu's collage of abstract figures looks like Picasso's <em>Guernica</em> and is emblematic of the mood Boldy paints on the album.
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carruth</li>
        <li>Surf & Turf (feat. Vince Staples)</li>
        <li>Run-Ins</li>
        <li>S.N.O.R.T. (feat. Freddie Gibbs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Others</h2>
      <p>These are albums that I enjoyed quite a bit, but not as much as the ones above.

      <h3>Eternal Atake - Lil Uzi Vert</h3>
      <p>It has a lot of songs sure, there are some skips, and I like the original version more than the deluxe version, but the highs on this album are high. <em>Eternal Atake</em> showcases Uzi's ability to make some of the best pop music and rap music. The hooks and vocal inflections on many tracks are excellent, and Uzi's personality is just as infectious.
</p>
      <p>"Baby Pluto" is one of my favorite introduction tracks of the year. It has you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the beat to drop. The gospel-trap fusions on the second half compliment Uzi's autotuned singing perfectly, and songs like "Bust Me" and "Prices" are incredibly catchy. "Futsal Shuffle 2020 (Bonus Track)" is still the best song on the project, even though it was released well before, but the European-style synths are such a good addition to Uzi's trap sound.
</p>
      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Myron</li>
        <li>Bean (Kobe) [feat. Chief Keef]</li>
        <li>Strawberry Peels (feat. Young Thug & Gunna)</li>
        <li>Baby Pluto</li>

      <h3>2017-2019 - Against All Logic</h3>
      <p>Nicolas Jaar rarely misses. I loved the first Against All Logic record, and <em>2017-2019</em> does not disappoint. "Fantasy" was one of my favorite tracks of the year. From the wonderful textures to the beautifully-chopped Beyoncé vocals, this track is as close to a perfect Against All Logic track as you can get. The selection of sounds and rhythmic elements are impeccable, and it's just so enjoyable. The album's industrial flavor sets it apart from its predecessor, and it's a welcome change. These songs are aggressive and loud, and you'll be surprised it was made by the same guy that produced <em>Space Is Only Noise</em>.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fantasy</li>
        <li>If You Can't Do It Good, Do It Hard (feat. Lydia Lunch)</li>
        <li>Alarm</li>
        <li>Deeeeeeefers</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <h3>1000 gecs and the tree of clues - 100 gecs</h3>
      <p>100 gecs sounds like you took pop music from 2005-2020, through it in a blender, added a dash of Monster Energy, and shotgunned the resulting concoction. Songs like "Hand Crushed by a Mallet (Remix) [feat. Fall Out Boy, Craig Owens, Nicole Dollanganger]" just make so much sense as Patrick Stump embodies the emo-style verse of the track. "Ringtone (Remix) [feat. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, Kero Kero Bonito]" might have been one of the best songs of the year, and again, the features make sense. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, and Kero Kero Bonito are a deadly combination and make the remix miles better than the already-good original song.
</p>

      <p>Sometimes I wish 100 gecs made all the pop music of the last decade. Imagine what "Hotline Bling" would have sounded like if 100 gecs made it. All I know is that I'm excited for whatever they do in 2021.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ringtone (Remix) [feat. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, Kero Kero Bonito]</li>
        <li>Hand Crushed by a Mallet (Remix) [feat. Fall Out Boy, Craig Owens, Nicole Dollanganger]</li>
        <li>xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx (Remix) [feat. Tommy Cash & Hannah Diamond]</li>
        <li>gecgecgec (Remix) [feat. Lil West and Tony Velour]</li>
        <li>gec 2 Ü (Remix) [feat. Dorian Electra]</li>
        <li>Toothless</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Whole Lotta Red - Playboi Carti</h3>
      <p>Carti's a rockstar and he knows it. This album was made for mosh pits, and I can only imagine being in one once the pandemic ends. Carti's vocal inflections on songs like "Stop Breathing" are incredible and say more than any lyrics could. Just like <em>Die Lit</em>, this album is fun and makes me want to jump around, which is exactly what I come to Playboi Carti for.
</p>

      <p>I think a lot of the hate this album got upon release was due to misplaced expectations on what Carti's next sound would be. A lot of people wanted Carti to either release the leaks or create songs in their same vein. But I think that would have been a losing strategy, as people would have complained if Carti did not drop enough new music, and people would have complained if Carti had just tried to recreate the hype of songs like "Pissy Pamper." He made the right move to take his sound in an unexpected direction, and the rockstar aesthetic fits him well.
</p>

      <p>I do have my gripes with this album. Some of the songs are not that good or complete, like "Go2DaMoon (feat. Kanye West)" and the features do more harm than good. This album could have used some more features but from some different artists. I think Rico Nasty or Young Thug would have done well over some of these beats.
</p>

      <p>Favorite songs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rockstar Made</li>
        <li>Stop Breathing</li>
        <li>Slay3r</li>
        <li>New Tank</li>
        <li>New N3on</li>
        <li>Control</li>
        <li>On That Time</li>
        <li>King Vamp</li>
      </ul>
